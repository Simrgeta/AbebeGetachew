  <h1>Privacy Policy — Abebe Getachew</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-08-26</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the app collects, how we use it, and how backups and cloud integrations (such as Dropbox or Google Drive) are handled.</p>

  <h2>What data we handle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local database files.</strong> The app uses an on-device SQLite/DB file to store user data (expenses, debts, settings). Backups export this database as a single <code>.Abebe Getachew</code> file.</li>
    <li><strong>Encryption metadata.</strong> We store initialization vectors and key metadata needed to decrypt backups — only on the user's device. We do not transmit encryption keys to our servers by default.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional cloud tokens.</strong> If you link a cloud provider (Dropbox), we save the provider access token locally on your device or in secure storage; we do not store tokens on our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Backups & cloud integrations (Dropbox)</h2>
  <p>When exporting a backup to Dropbox:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The app encrypts your database locally using strong AES encryption (AES-256) before any upload.</li>
    <li>We use the official Dropbox SDK and OAuth flow. You explicitly sign into Dropbox and grant the app permission.</li>
    <li>The app only uploads the encrypted <code>.Abebe Getachew</code> file. Dropbox will receive the encrypted file and any Dropbox account metadata necessary to store it.</li>
    <li>We do not retain copies of your backup on our servers. All backups are created, encrypted and uploaded from your device unless you explicitly share them elsewhere.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Scopes & Dropbox permissions</h2>
  <p>Abebe Getachew requests only the scopes required to perform uploads. For a Scoped Dropbox App we typically request the minimum scopes such as <code>files.content.write</code> to create files in the user's Dropbox (or Saver/Chooser flows if used). You will see the exact permission request during the OAuth consent screen.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Backups are encrypted on the device before any network transfer.</li>
    <li>We recommend that you protect your device with a passcode/biometrics.</li>
    <li>Stored tokens are kept in secure device storage (Android Keystore/EncryptedSharedPreferences) if available.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>We do not keep copies of backups on our servers. Any backups you create and upload to Dropbox will be stored in your Dropbox account according to Dropbox's retention and deletion policies.</p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>We rely on third-party services (Dropbox, Google) solely to store files if you choose. Their privacy policies apply to the parts of the experience they handle. Always review third-party privacy policies before granting permissions.</p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Revoke Dropbox access anytime from your Dropbox account settings.</li>
    <li>Delete backups you uploaded from within Dropbox.</li>
    <li>Delete your local data using the app's "Reset" or "Clear data" feature.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy or data handling: <a href="mailto:awashsimrgeta123@gmail.com">awashsimrgeta123@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this document to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. We'll post the date of last update at the top of this page.</p>
